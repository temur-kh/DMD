   88  Step two: Granting access to the user
   89  Let's say you have your WordPress server set up (running on IP address 192.168.1.100) to access a MySQL database named wordpressdb on the MySQL server with user wpadmin. On the MySQL server, you must grant access to the wordpressdb to that user from that IP address. Here's how to grant the user access (I'm assuming you already created the user wpadmin on the MySQL server and given it password %u#098Tl3).
   90  Log in to the MySQL server.
   91  Log in to MySQL with the command mysql -u root -p
   92  Type the MySQL root user password.
   93  Issue the MySQL command:
   94  GRANT ALL ON wordpressdb.* TO 'wpadmin'@'192.168.1.100' IDENTIFIED BY '%u#098Tl3' WITH GRANT OPTION;
   95  Flush the MySQL privileges with the command FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
   96  Exit out of the MySQL prompt with the command exit;
   97  Your WordPress instance (set up with the proper user credentials for the database) should be able to use the remote MySQL server as its database host.
   98  Congratulations! You successfully set up MySQL for remote connections.
   99  Keep it secure
  100  Although you can open MySQL for connections from remote servers, you should only grant privileges for select users to avoid possible security breaches. Also, be sure those users use very strong passwords. When you combine that with keeping your MySQL server up to date, you should be good to go.
